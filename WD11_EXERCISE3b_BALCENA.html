            <p>Legazpi City has a tropical rainforest 
                climate and experiences a considerable 
                amount of rainfall every year. January 
                is the coolest month while May and June 
                are the hottest months. 
    
                Weather-wise, the best time to visit is 
                during the summer months between March through May. 
                This way, you can make the most out of the many outdoor 
                activities available. If you wish to experience 
                the Ibalong Festival though, you should visit when 
                it happens in August.</p>

            or non-air-conditioned bus from Manila to

            bus from any of these points: Araneta Center 
            Bus Station, EDSA-Cubao, LRT-Buendia via EDSA-Pasay, 
            Ermita or Alabang. All these buses will

            Finding transportation is fairly easy 
            in the city of Legazpi. Public utility 
            vehicles such as tricycles, jeepneys, 
            UV Express vans, and taxis are available.

                    <br>
                    <p>Tricycles are three-wheeled 
                        motorcycle cabs. You will usually 
                        find them waiting for passengers at a 
                        designated tricycle stop. Take note 
                        that tricycles can only take you 
                        to designated locations.
    
                        Tricycles usually need to fill 
                        their cab with four to eight passengers 
                        before leaving. If you don't want to wait,
                         you'll need to rent the tricycle and pay 
                         for the corresponding rate.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Riding a jeepney is the cheapest way to

                        designated route. You can look at the sides of the 
                        jeepneys or on the signboard on the window to find 
                        out what their route is.
    
                        UV Express vans are air-conditioned utility 
                        vehicles that usually seat 10 - 12 passengers. 
                        Like jeepneys, they also follow a designated route.
                        
                        You can find a jeepney and UV Express 
                        terminal at the LKY Metro Transport and 
                        Lifestyle Hub, a small commercial center right 
                        across from the Legazpi Grand Central Terminal.</p>

                Dominating the entire province of Albay, 
                it is one of the most active volcanoes in the 
                Philippines and dubbed as the “world’s nearly perfect cone”. 
                It stands majestically at 8,189 feet above sea level from a 
                board base about 10 km. in radius. The crater, with a diameter of 1/2 km. 
                has a notched rim from which can be seen a pool of bubbling 
                hot lava in the center and rich coal deposits on the sides. 
                Through this crater whiffs off sulfuric steams and gases which 
                are constantly emitted. From the top, one can get a good full view 
                of the Albay Gulf and other outlying towns that lie in the periphery of its base.
                Mayon derived its name from the Bicol word “Magayon” meaning 
                beautiful which has been regarded as the symbol of Albay.

                Of all the volcanoes in the Philippines, 
                Mayon Volcano or Mount Mayon is the most 
                iconic because of its perfect cone shape. 
                With the majestic view it offers, doing Mayon 
                Volcano tours like the Mayon ATV activity has 
                become the main itinerary of travelers visiting the region.

                basics of operating the vehicles and gave you a rundown of the
